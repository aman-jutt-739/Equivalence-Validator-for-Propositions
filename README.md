# Equivalence-Validator-for-Propositions
This program in developed in C++ by using the concepts of Discrete Structures to determine whether the 2 input logical expressions are logically equivalent or not and then generate truth tables for both expressions. If the logical expressions are not equivalent, then the truth table shows from where the difference occurs.
